Developing a MEAN app with Angular 2.0



A MEAN stack app would typically consist of a server layer built with Nodejs & Express â€“ Express
being the web framework. MongoDB for data persistence & Angular as the client side MVW framework.

As you can see from the above diagram, Express exposes REST End points that would be consumed by the Angular 2.0 app.
And when any request is made to the REST end point, Express contacts MongoDB and manages the data.
